# Password-Generator-App

## Description


The drive behind this project was to create an application that would generate a password based on a user's personal preference and requirements. Random password generators enhance security and help protect senstive data. Thus the rationale behind building this application was to do just that, elevate the protection of sensitive data by generating strong passwords. 
Users have the ability to set their password length and which character types are included based on their own needs or preference. 

Building this app expanded my understanding of the capabilities of JavaScript. Having only been introduced to JS one week ago, I now see the fantastic functionality it can bring to any webpage, site or app. 


## Usage

To use this application, start by clicking on the Generate Password button, as shown below, to select the password length.
Answer the prompt with 'Ok' for yes, or 'Cancel' for no.

Then follow through the prompts as shown below, again answering 'Ok' for yes, and 'Cancel' for no.

![Numeric Option](../Password-Generator-App/Assets/images%20/Screenshot-numeric.png)
![Special Character Option](../Password-Generator-App/Assets/images%20/Screenshot-specialC.png)

Once all criteria have been chosen, a password will generate in the box bordered with a dashed line. 

If no criteria are selected, the following message will be prompted, see below.
